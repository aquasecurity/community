# Welcome to the Aqua Open Source Community

The following section provides an overview of our community and resources as well as ways that you can get involved.

Please make sure that you [follow the Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in any interaction with the Aqua Open Source community, employees, and other stakeholder.

The Code of Conduct has been adopted from 
[![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.1-4baaaa.svg)](code_of_conduct.md)  

## Our main projects

[**Trivy**](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) is a comprehensive and versatile security scanner. Trivy supports different scanners (things is can find) as well as targets (things is can scan).

[**Tracee**](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tracee) is a runtime security and forensics tool. It uses Linux eBPF technology to trace your system and give you insight into it's behavior.

While these are the top-level initiatives we have, contribution might be needed in supporting repositories. For example in `trivy-db` for Trivy or in `libbpfgo` for Tracee.

## How you can get involved

A good way to start is to first familiarize yourself with the project, take some time to assimilate within the community, and engage in issues and discussions. Contributions might be in the form of:

- Engaging with the community, asking ans answering questions, testing and providing feedback.
- Creating content, for example, improving documentation, creating tutorials, speaking and advocating about the projects elsewhere.
- Contributing code, fixing bugs and creating new features.

When you want to make a contribution, start by searching for existing issues or discussions which need help (look for the `good-first-issue` and `help-wanted` label), or create an issue if needed.  
The documentation of Trivy and Tracee does have "contributing" sections for helping you get started with either project specifically.

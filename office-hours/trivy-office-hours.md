Before each meeting we post a new GitHub Discussion in the Trivy repository.
There, you will be able to propose topics.

Topics may include:
* Specific Questions about the roadmap of Trivy or related projects
* Sharing Trivy use case/implementation -- Tell us how you are using Trivy!
* If you have created any Trivy related work that you are proud of (presentation, blog, PR) -- this is your time to show & tell 

Please keep all presentations & discussions to 10min to allow for more items on the agenda.
If it is a topic that has to be discussed in more detail we may assign more time to it.
